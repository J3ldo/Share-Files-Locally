# Share Files Locally
A website that will make you able to share files locally.  
This was made as a project for my dad and is just to get him off sharing in the cloud or mail. Because he wanted that.  
Please note that this is super invonrable and if you want to host this publicly you need to improve the site.  
  
The software i used to host the server locally: <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">XAMPP</a>
